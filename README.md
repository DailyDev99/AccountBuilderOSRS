This is a script to generate tasks (x minutes and x levels in skill) for each skill in the game.<br>
I'm not using any kind of weight distribution because this is only a demo on how you can do it without making it too complicated.<br>
<b>The Goldfarming and Woodcutting class are examples on what it could look like.
This code is from 2021 and wrote it in about 10 minutes and the project is actually over 10k lines</b>, sold the whole project because of Corona.<br><br>
The project made me use my brain a bit more because I always wanted to automate a lot of processes in the game and I didn't really know what to do. 
As of early 2022 I began learning Python for Machine Learning (for fun) and I hope I can use that experience to help people.
